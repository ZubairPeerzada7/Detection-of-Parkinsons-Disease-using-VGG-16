The goal of the system is to provide a tool for detecting Parkinson's disease by analyzing hand-drawn images of spirals and waves. Users of the system can submit their own hand-drawn images to the application, which will then use the VGG-16 network to train and predict whether the user has Parkinson's disease. The VGG-16 network is a convolutional neural network that has been trained on the ImageNet dataset and is commonly used for image classification tasks.

To use the system, a user would need to submit a hand-drawn image of a spiral or wave. The image would be preprocessed and prepared for input into the VGG-16 network, which would then use its trained weights and biases to make a prediction about whether the user has Parkinson's disease. If the prediction is positive, the system would provide medical and therapeutic information to the user for further diagnosis.

The system is evaluated based on its ability to detect different directions during drawing movements, and it reportedly achieves the best results for the X and Y directions. The experimental results show that the system has an accuracy of 92.6%. It is important to note that the accuracy of the system may vary depending on the specific dataset and training conditions used.

It is worth noting that using a machine learning model like VGG-16 to detect Parkinson's disease is just one part of the diagnostic process and should be used in conjunction with other techniques and tools. It is always important to consult with a medical professional for an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan for Parkinson's disease.
