# Detection-of-Parkinsons-Disease-using-VGG-16
Parkinson's disease is a progressive disorder of the nervous system that affects several regions of the brain, most notably an area called the substantia nigra which controls balance and movement. The most common initial symptom of Parkinson's disease is tremors or shaking in a limb, especially when the body is at rest. The tremor usually begins on one side of the body, often in one hand, but it can also affect the arms, legs, feet, and face. Other characteristic symptoms of Parkinson's disease include stiffness in the limbs and chest, slow movement (bradykinesia), and postural instability. These symptoms tend to worsen over time. In this article, we present a system for detecting Parkinson's disease using the VGG-16 network and transfer learning. The system allows users to submit hand-drawn images of spirals and waves, which are then trained and predicted using the VGG-16 network. If the user is found to have Parkinson's disease, the system provides medical and therapeutic information for further diagnosis. The system is evaluated on its ability to detect different directions during drawing movements, and it achieves the best results for the X and Y directions. The experimental results show that the system has an accuracy of 92.6%."
